Job Application Tracker - Project Documentation
1. Project Overview
Project Title: Job Application Tracker
Project Description:
The Job Application Tracker is a web-based application designed to help job seekers manage and track their job applications efficiently. The platform allows users to add, edit, and track applications, update job statuses, and receive smart reminders for follow-ups. With secure authentication (JWT) and a MongoDB database, the system ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience.
Unique Feature: Smart Follow-Up Reminder System
Unlike LinkedIn and other job-tracking apps, this platform includes an AI-powered Smart Follow-Up Reminder System. This feature analyzes the time elapsed since an application was submitted and suggests personalized follow-up actions based on the company's response time trends. Users receive automated reminders to follow up via email or LinkedIn, ensuring better engagement with recruiters and improving hiring chances.
Target Audience:
Job seekers looking to track applications effectively.
Students and fresh graduates applying for internships.
Professionals switching jobs and handling multiple applications simultaneously.
